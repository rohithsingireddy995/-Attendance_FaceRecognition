Ensuring regular student attendance is a fundamental concern for educational institutions, as it directly impacts academic performance and overall student engagement. Traditional methods of tracking attendance, such as roll calls and paper sign-ins, are increasingly inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies and manipulation. Consequently, there is a pressing need for an automated, reliable, and efficient attendance management system.
This project introduces a student attendance system leveraging facial recognition technology to address the limitations of conventional methods. Facial recognition technology provides a non-intrusive, contactless approach to verifying student identities and marking attendance. The system operates by capturing images of students' faces in real-time, analyzing these images to extract unique facial features, and matching them with pre-stored faceprints in a database. Once a match is identified, the system automatically records the student's attendance.
Key functionalities of the system include real-time face detection, facial feature analysis, faceprint matching, and automated attendance record generation. The system also compiles attendance data and sends it to faculty members in Excel format, ensuring easy access and management. Developed using Python and utilizing powerful libraries such as OpenCV, Dlib, and face_recognition, the system aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution for modern attendance management.
The implementation of this system promises significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, making it a valuable tool for educational institutions. By automating the attendance process, the system not only saves time but also enhances the overall accuracy and integrity of attendance records, contributing to better academic performance and institutional efficiency.
